#The SharedKernel Project
This project contain functions that would likely be shared between multiple projects.
Do not change it if not necessary (not recommended).

#The Core Project
The Core project is the center of the Clean Architecture design, and all other project dependencies should point toward it (Dependency inversion principle). As such, it has very few external dependencies.
This includes the things like business logic of service, domain logic or event sourcing.

#The Infrastructure Project
This includes data access (connect to database) and domain event implementations or maybe the things like email providers, file access, web api clients, etc.

#The Web API Project
The entry point of the application is the ASP.NET Core web api project (User interface).This will call to Core Project.

#The Test Projects
Test projects could be organized based on the kind of test (unit, functional, integration, performance, etc.) or by the project they are testing (Core, Infrastructure, Web), or both.
